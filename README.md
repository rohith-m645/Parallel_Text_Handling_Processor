# 📃 Parallel Text Handling Processor

A high-performance Streamlit application that processes large-scale text data using Python's multiprocessing capabilities. Designed for language experts and data workers to mine text efficiently without special NLP tools.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This system handles big text sets, runs tasks in parallel like sentiment scoring with rule-based rules, and builds searchable indexes. It supports batch processing via CSV files and provides automated email summaries.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ⚡ Parallel text processing using `ProcessPoolExecutor` (bypasses Python GIL)
- 📂 Upload TXT, CSV, XLSX, DOCX, or PDF files
- 🔁 Processes up to **1,000,000 rows** at a time
- 🧠 Rule-based sentiment scoring (no ML libraries needed)
- 🗄️ SQLite database with WAL optimization for fast storage
- 📊 Interactive sentiment distribution chart
- 📥 Download reports as Excel (50k preview or full 1M)
- 📧 Automated email summaries via Gmail SMTP

## 🧩 Modules

### Module 1 — Text Breaker and Loader
> *Breaks text using multi-tasking groups. Uses patterns for first filters.*

- `read_file()` — Loads TXT, CSV, XLSX, DOCX, PDF into text lines
- `tokenize()` — Breaks text into word tokens using regex patterns
- `clean_text()` — Removes special characters and non-ASCII content
- Data is split into batches of 50,000 lines for parallel processing
- `@st.cache_data` prevents re-loading the same file on every rerun

---

### Module 2 — Rule Checker and Scorer
> *Scores in tasks at the same time. Saves results in a simple database.*

- `calculate_score()` — Scores each text using positive/negative word lists
- `classify()` — Classifies text into 10 categories:
  - Positive, Negative, Neutral
  - Refund Issue, Delivery Issue, Product Damage
  - Customer Service, Price Complaint, Spam, Scam Risk, Sarcasm
- `ProcessPoolExecutor` runs scoring across all CPU cores simultaneously
- Results saved to **SQLite** with optimized PRAGMA settings:
  - `journal_mode=WAL` — faster concurrent writes
  - `synchronous=NORMAL` — balanced speed and safety
  - Bulk commits every 200,000 rows for efficiency

---

### Module 3 — Search Checker and File Saver
> *Lets you search and save to Excel files. Sends email summaries.*

- Results displayed in an interactive table (first 1,000 rows preview)
- Export to Excel:
  - **Small Report** — first 50,000 rows (~10MB)
  - **Full Report** — all 1,000,000 rows (write-only Workbook for memory efficiency)
- Email summary sent via Gmail SMTP with Excel report attached
- Sentiment summary counts shown for all categories

---

### Module 4 — Text Storage Improver
> *Builds and keeps good lists. Handles changes with little work.*

- SQLite database auto-created on first run
- `@st.cache_resource` keeps DB connection alive across reruns
- Session state (`st.session_state`) persists results across button clicks
- Word lists use Python `set()` for O(1) lookup speed
- Database schema supports incremental inserts without full rebuilds

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/parallel-text-processor.git
cd parallel-text-processor
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up Gmail credentials
